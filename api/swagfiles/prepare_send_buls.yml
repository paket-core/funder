Transfer BULs to another pubkey.
Use this call to prepare a transaction that sends part of your balance to another user. This function will return an unsigned transaction.
You can use the [laboratory](https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/#txsigner?network=test) to sign the transaction with your private key.
You can use the /recover_user call to find out your seed.
Than, you can either submit the signed transaction in the laboratory,
or use the /submit_transaction call to send the signed transaction for submission.

The to_pubkey can be either a user id, or a wallet pubkey.
